- [x] Successfully tested game state management

### CRITICAL FIXES - Security & Concurrency
- [x] **FIXED: Race Conditions** - Added proper asyncio.Lock for game state modifications
- [x] **FIXED: Security Vulnerabilities** - Implemented JWT-based authentication system
- [x] **FIXED: WebSocket Security** - Added token validation for all WebSocket actions
- [x] **FIXED: Configuration Inconsistency** - Updated to Python 3.12.3 with consistent versioning
- [x] **FIXED: Async State Management** - Made critical game store methods async with proper locking
- [x] **FIXED: JWT Import Issues** - Added proper fallback handling and type ignore for development

### ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS - God File Refactoring
- [x] **FIXED: Brittle Prompt Parsing** - Replaced string splitting with robust Pydantic-based DecisionParser
- [x] **FIXED: Hardcoded Values** - Removed magic number 1000, now uses room settings for starting chips
- [x] **FIXED: Monolithic AgentManager** - Broke down into specialized services:
  - [x] PromptBuilder - Isolates prompt construction logic
  - [x] DecisionParser - Robust LLM response parsing with multiple fallback strategies
  - [x] BehaviorUpdater - Manages agent behavior state separately
  - [x] VoiceLineGenerator - Handles all voice-related logic
- [x] **FIXED: Monolithic main.py** - Separated into focused routers:
  - [x] rooms.py - Room management endpoints
  - [x] games.py - Game action endpoints
  - [x] agents.py - Agent management endpoints
  - [x] websockets.py - WebSocket handling
- [x] **FIXED: Business Logic in Store** - Created GameService to separate business logic from data storage
- [x] **FIXED: Configuration Mismatch** - All todos now reflect Python 3.12.3 requirement
