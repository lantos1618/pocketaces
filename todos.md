- [x] Setup script for easy installation

## 🚧 In Progress

### Core Game Engine
- [ ] Poker engine with hand evaluation
- [ ] Game state management
- [ ] Turn-based gameplay logic
- [ ] Hand ranking system

### API Routes
- [ ] Game routes (create room, join game, make action)
- [ ] Agent routes (list agents, get stats, get memories)
- [ ] WebSocket routes for real-time updates

## 📋 Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Poker Engine** - Implement core game logic
   - [ ] Hand evaluation algorithm
   - [ ] Betting logic and pot management
   - [ ] Game phase progression
   - [ ] Winner determination

2. **API Routes** - Create REST endpoints
   - [ ] Room management endpoints
   - [ ] Game action endpoints
   - [ ] Agent management endpoints
   - [ ] WebSocket connection handling

3. **Voice Integration** - ElevenLabs integration
   - [ ] Voice synthesis service
   - [ ] Personality-specific voice generation
   - [ ] Voice caching system
   - [ ] Real-time voice streaming

### Medium Priority
4. **WebSocket Implementation** - Real-time communication
   - [ ] Game room WebSocket connections
   - [ ] Real-time game updates
   - [ ] Agent voice streaming
   - [ ] Player action broadcasting

5. **Agent Interactions** - Agent-to-agent communication
   - [ ] Agent calling system
   - [ ] Strategy discussions
   - [ ] Trash talk between agents
   - [ ] Personality-driven interactions

6. **Benchmarking System** - Performance tracking
   - [ ] Real-time statistics
   - [ ] Agent performance metrics
   - [ ] Game outcome analysis
   - [ ] Performance comparison tools

### Low Priority
7. **Frontend Integration** - Basic UI
   - [ ] Simple HTML/JS interface
   - [ ] Game state visualization
   - [ ] Agent selection interface
   - [ ] Real-time game display

8. **Database Integration** - Persistent storage
   - [ ] SQLite setup with Drizzle
   - [ ] Game history persistence
   - [ ] Agent memory storage
   - [ ] Performance data storage

9. **Advanced Features** - Stretch goals
   - [ ] Tournament mode
   - [ ] Multiple game variants
   - [ ] Advanced agent personalities
   - [ ] Machine learning integration

## 🐛 Known Issues

- [ ] LangChain imports need to be installed
- [ ] Missing poker engine implementation
- [ ] API routes not yet created
- [ ] WebSocket handling not implemented

## 🎯 Demo Goals

For the hackathon demo, we need:
1. ✅ Working data structures
2. ✅ Agent personalities defined
3. ✅ Basic game store
4. [ ] Simple poker game logic
5. [ ] Basic API endpoints
6. [ ] Real-time game updates
7. [ ] Agent voice synthesis
8. [ ] Demo interface

## 📝 Notes

- Focus on getting a basic working demo first
- Voice features can be added incrementally
- Agent personalities are well-defined and ready
- Mock data allows for rapid development
- LangChain integration provides sophisticated AI behavior
