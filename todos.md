## üìã Next Steps

### High Priority
1. **Code Smells Cleanup** - Improve maintainability
   - [ ] Move imports to top of files
   - [ ] Replace giant f-string with PromptTemplate in agent_manager.py
   - [ ] Remove redundant event handlers in main.py
   - [ ] Fix remaining circular import issues

2. **Authentication Enhancement** - Production-ready auth
   - [ ] Add token refresh mechanism
   - [ ] Implement proper session management
   - [ ] Add rate limiting for API endpoints
   - [ ] Add proper error handling for auth failures

3. **Testing Infrastructure** - Ensure reliability
   - [ ] Unit tests for game store with concurrency
   - [ ] Integration tests for authentication flow
   - [ ] Load tests for WebSocket connections
   - [ ] Security tests for authorization

### Medium Priority
4. **WebSocket Implementation** - Real-time communication
   - [x] Game room WebSocket connections
   - [x] Real-time game updates
   - [ ] Agent voice streaming
   - [ ] Player action broadcasting

5. **Agent Interactions** - Agent-to-agent communication
   - [ ] Agent calling system
   - [ ] Strategy discussions
   - [ ] Trash talk between agents
   - [ ] Personality-driven interactions

6. **Benchmarking System** - Performance tracking
   - [ ] Real-time statistics
   - [ ] Agent performance metrics
   - [ ] Game outcome analysis
   - [ ] Performance comparison tools

### Low Priority
7. **Frontend Integration** - Basic UI
   - [ ] Simple HTML/JS interface
   - [ ] Game state visualization
   - [ ] Agent selection interface
   - [ ] Real-time game display

8. **Database Integration** - Persistent storage
   - [ ] SQLite setup with Drizzle
   - [ ] Game history persistence
   - [ ] Agent memory storage
   - [ ] Performance data storage

9. **Advanced Features** - Stretch goals
   - [ ] Tournament mode
   - [ ] Multiple game variants
   - [ ] Advanced agent personalities
   - [ ] Machine learning integration

## üêõ Known Issues

- [x] LangChain imports need to be installed
- [x] Missing poker engine implementation
- [x] API routes not yet created
- [x] WebSocket handling not implemented
- [x] **CRITICAL: Race conditions in game state** - FIXED ‚úÖ
- [x] **CRITICAL: No authentication/authorization** - FIXED ‚úÖ
- [x] **CRITICAL: Configuration version mismatch** - FIXED ‚úÖ

## üéØ Demo Goals

For the hackathon demo, we need:
1. ‚úÖ Working data structures
2. ‚úÖ Agent personalities defined
3. ‚úÖ Basic game store
4. ‚úÖ Simple poker game logic
5. ‚úÖ Basic API endpoints
6. ‚úÖ Real-time game updates
7. [ ] Agent voice synthesis
8. [ ] Demo interface

## üìù Notes
